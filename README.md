#C++ Game - by Jens Coenders
This is a SDL-based 2D game library, which includes a test application.

#Depencendies and project layout
Like mentioned above, this game is based on the SDL2 library (SDL2 files are stored in the 'dep' directory)
The game_* functions are used to control the game library. Sometimes they are also used to interact with the SDL2 library.

#Collaborating
This project is meant to be a private project for 
Feel free, however, to clone this repository and start working on it yourself.

#Project setup
I created this project using the Eclipse IDE (with CDT plugin).
Therefore, the repository files .cproject and .project are generated by Eclipse and cannot be used by any other IDE.
The project also contains Makefiles, which require the GNU Make program.
These Makefiles use the GNU GCC compiler to build the library and test application.

The library creates a renderer thread, which manages the updating and rendering of game objects.
Shared values are stored in a Shared Memory system.
A shared memory generator (available in the scripts directory) can convert a specially-formatted file into a .h and .cpp file.
