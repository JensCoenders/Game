#C++ Game - by Jens Coenders
This is a SDL-based playable (2D) game, which is also easy to change.

#Depencendies and project layout
Like mentioned above, this game is based on the SDL2 library (located in the lib directory).
The Game_Controller class includes a SDL-wrapper, to make sure only some parts of the project have deal with SDL itself.

#Collaborating
This project is meant to be my private project and I'm not planning on changing that.
Feel free, however, to clone this repository and start working on it yourself.

#Project setup
I created this project in Eclipse (with CDT plugin).
Therefore, the repository folders .settings and the files .cproject and .project are generated by eclipse.
So if you are planning on using another IDE for this project, you'll have to setup the project by yourself.

As the name sais, the Game_Controller controls the game; it manages SDL, objects, game flow, etc.
It is meant as an interface between the object and game handling file (currently main.cpp) and the game fysics.
